## App Explanation

There are countless awesome apps out there for tracking the results of more
generalized workouts and some good ones for specific activies, but as far as
I've found, very few to none for rock climbing.  So, I decided to make one.

This web app is an indoor climbing training resource for identifying difficult
movements and improving at executing them.  Users can input the
results of their climbing sessions by adding the gym they climbed in and traits
of climbs they fell on.  They can then see a list of these
climbs to pick out trends that they can work on improving.  If they want
personalized training suggestions, they can request to see the holds that they
fall on most frequently along with advice on how to target muscle
groups that are required for more efficient use of those holds.
