## App Explanation

This web app is an indoor rock climbing training resource for identifying
difficult movements and improving at executing them.  Users can input the
results of their climbing sessions by adding the gym they climbed in and
specific traits of climbs they fell on.  They can then see a list of these
climbs to pick out trends that they could work on improving.  If they want
personalized training suggestions, they can request to see the holds that they
fall on most frequently along with advice on how to target muscle
groups that are required for more efficient use of those holds.
